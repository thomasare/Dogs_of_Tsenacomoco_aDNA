# The Dogs of Tsenacomoco: Ancient DNA Reveals the Presence of Local Dogs at Jamestown Colony in the Early Seventeenth Century

### Abstract
Multiple studies have demonstrated that European colonization of the Americas led to the death of nearly all
North American dog mitochondrial lineages and replacement with European ones sometime between AD
1492 and the present day. Historical records indicate that colonists imported dogs from Europe to North
America, where they became objects of interest and exchange as early as the seventeenth century.
However, it is not clear whether the earliest archaeological dogs recovered from colonial contexts were of
European, Indigenous, or mixed descent. To clarify the ancestry of dogs from the Jamestown Colony,
Virginia, we sequenced ancient mitochondrial DNA from six archaeological dogs from the period 1609–
1617. Our analysis shows that the Jamestown dogs have maternal lineages most closely associated with
those of ancient Indigenous dogs of North America. Furthermore, these maternal lineages cluster with
dogs from Late Woodland, Hopewell, and Virginia Algonquian archaeological sites. Our recovery of
Indigenous dog lineages from a European colonial site suggests a complex social history of dogs at the inter-
face of Indigenous and European populations during the early colonial period.
